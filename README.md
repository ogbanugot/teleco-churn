# teleco-churn
ML Task for Predicting Customer Churn for a Teleco

## Dataset
The dataset is from this Kaggle repo https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics

## Training Results
The notebook [Teleco-Churn-Prediction.ipynb](Teleco-Churn-Prediction.ipynb) has the main preprocessing, training and evaluation results.

## Discussion & Recommendations
XGBoost is the best performing model overall based on the metrics:

Accuracy: Highest at 83.83%  
Precision: Highest at 87.85%  
Recall: Highest at 90.56%  
F1-score: Highest at 89.18%  
AUC-ROC: Highest at 89.19%  

### Why XGBoost?
XGBoost consistently outperforms the other models across all metrics, especially in precision and recall, which is critical in a churn prediction context where catching all possible churn cases is crucial.
The AUC-ROC score of XGBoost is also the highest, indicating better performance in distinguishing between churned and non-churned customers.

### Recommendations
1. Model Evaluation and Validation
Further Evaluation: Although XGBoost performs best, we can validate its performance further by using techniques such as cross-validation and ensuring there is no overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: We might explore hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost to potentially improve its performance even further.
2. Operational Considerations
Training Time: XGBoost can be more resource-intensive compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest. We will need to ensure that our infrastructure can handle the computational requirements for XGBoost.  
Model Complexity: XGBoost is more complex compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Ensuring that we have the necessary interpretability and explainability tools to understand and trust the modelâ€™s predictions is key.  
3. Business Implementation
Deploying XGBoost: We should use the XGBoost model for the churn prediction system and integrate it for real-time predictions.
Monitor and Update: We should continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as new data comes in or as the business environment changes.
4. Additional Strategies
Ensemble Methods: We can Consider using ensemble methods like stacking models if computational resources allow. This can potentially combine the strengths of different models to achieve even better performance.
Customer Segmentation: We should use the model's predictions to segment customers into different risk categories and tailor retention strategies accordingly.

## Model Serving & Deployment
To integrate the best model (xgboost) with existing systems, we can create a REST API that takes in customer data and returns the 
model prediction. We can then containerize this service and deploy it.  
To illustrate this I have built a simple FastAPI App and deployed it on a fly.io VM.

### Make a POST Request (To the live API) for Churn Prediction:

Note: This VM has `auto_stop` so it might take a few seconds to spin up and respond.

```

## Run the server (locally) with Python
First install requirements
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, provide a `.env` file with keys:
```text
MODEL_PATH='best_xgboost.joblib'
PREPROCESSOR_PATH='preprocessor_pipeline.joblib'
```

Run the dev server:
```commandline
uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --reload
```

## Deploy via Dockerfile to fly.io
Based on this https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/

Create the fly app
```commandline
 fly apps create telcom
```

The launch command is optional since there is a `fly.toml` file already
```commandline
fly launch --no-deploy
```

deploy app
```commandline
fly deploy --ha=false
```

### Optional
scale the memory
```commandline
flyctl scale memory 2048 -a tlb
```
scale the vm
```commandline
fly scale vm shared-cpu-2x --vm-memory 4096 -a tlb
```
